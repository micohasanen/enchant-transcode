WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
Things. And we also talked about what kinds 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.360
of intelligence help they needed and well, as diplomatic help 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.840
that we might be able to do as well. The needs 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.840
, of course, are quickly evolving over time 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.500
. So we will work with the Israeli government 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.010
and the Biden administration to assemble the most generous 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.790
package possible. When I returned to Washington 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.240
, I'm going to direct Senators Murray Reid and Cardin 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.870
, heads of the most relevant committees to work with their ranking 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.200
Republican members and the Biden administration 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.380
to pull together a package that the Senate can take up as 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.560
soon as possible, hopefully within the next few weeks 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.980
. Now the people will ask, what about the House 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.100
? We're not waiting for the house. We believe if 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.760
the Senate acts in a strong bipartisan way, it 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.240
may indeed improve the chances that the House 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.720
, even with its current dysfunction, will act. 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.220
So the bottom line is that 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.360
October 7th is a day that will no doubt live in infamy 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.510
. My guess is I'll think of it every day for 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.760
the rest of my life. Just as 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.880
I think of nine over 11 every day for the rest of my life 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.630
. And we just want to be clear 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.020
to the Israeli people during these such difficult times. I talked 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.710
I just asked four random Israelis, the guy driving the car 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.430
, a waiter at the restaurant, and two others. I bumped into every 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.700
one of them knows somebody who's close to them, who 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.790
has been lost. So it's such a 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.000
difficult time, but 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.360
we know the difficulty of their task. But 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.570
we also know success. The elimination of the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.750
threat of Hamas is vital. Israel has a 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.080
right to defend itself and eliminate the threat to 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.200
Hamas to make sure this evil 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.440
never happens again 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.740
. Our prayers are with all of those killed and taken hostage their 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.920
families, the thousands injured. May 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.250
the memories of the dead be a blessing and a 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.490
source of strength to all of us as we navigate this 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.850
challenging future with fortitude of spirit 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.880
and solidarity, of purpose 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.120
. Once again, Jackie, do you want to go next 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.360


00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.990
? Whoops, I'm not that tall. We have been watching Senator 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.290
Chuck Schumer speak. He is in Tel Aviv along with a bipartisan 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.620
group of senators. They're showing us support for Israel 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.010
. We will continue to monitor the latest on the Israel 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.340
Hamas conflict. For now, we are going to take a quick break

. So we may have a recession. Listening to how someone 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.680

going? Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Were there death threats? How is this 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.890
possible? What's wrong with that argument? Are you saying they lied? Have you told the government 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.040
that? Why won't you say the word crisis? You're not answering my question. This really 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.370
Is that scary? Does that make sense? What do you mean? What does that mean? Did any of that make sense 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.760

fun loving party boy, but the alcohol got the better of 

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.880
him. What I envisioned was him being in some sort of medical

fun loving party boy, but the alcohol got the better of 

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.420
him. What I envisioned was him being in some sort of medical 

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.870
facility. I just thought what a great candidate 

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.230
for them to learn about the results of alcoholism 

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.920
and what it does to a body. But his body was 

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.550
sold to the military, specifically used 

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.790

. And I had the box. I don't know if they were his ashes 

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.170
or not. I just held it as tight as I could and I just 

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.770
told him how sorry I was. Body brokers now streaming

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.270
surprise attack on Israel, and that's put a new 

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.480
focus on tensions in the Middle East and just how we 

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.080
got here. Seth Doane has a Sunday journal 

00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.420

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.990
At least 1300 people in Israel have been killed in 

00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.440
Gaza. At least 2100. The story 

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.800
somehow keeps getting worse. Israel vows to crush 

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.310
Hamas. As we watch and read, sometimes reluctantly 

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.490
faced with the reality of yet another war in the middle 

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:48.150
East, this time sparked by the unimaginable brutality 

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.360
and barbarity of those surprise attacks by 

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:54.870
Hamas. This is an act of sheer evil 

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.590
. This country was created in the aftermath of the Holocaust and 

00:14:58.590 --> 00:15:01.710
it's based on a promise, a promise that this state would 

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:05.400
protect Jews from precisely these type of atrocities 

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.700
. And this was the largest single incident of Jewish 

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.790
death of murder since the Holocaust 

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:15.180

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.930
fire rockets at Israel from the Gaza Strip. The house 

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.230
next door was destroyed. It's very real for us. We've all 

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.620
known people, Seth, every one of us who have 

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.920
been massacred, dismembered 

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.070

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.210
? Robin Wright is a contributor to The New Yorker and has been 

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.220
covering wars across the Middle East 

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.520
for the last 50 years. I think Prime Minister 

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.940
Netanyahu thinks he can destroy Hamas, but 

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.600
can he destroy the idea, the politics and 

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.080
the commitment by Palestinians who feel 

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.540
that there's no prospect down the road of 

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.960
a two state solution, who don't see the restoration 

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:16.200
of their freedom, their dignity, their jobs 

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.500
, the economy. I think this is far 

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.920
harder than the kind of simplistic language that 

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.280
Netanyahu has been using. Still, Israel's defense 

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.580
ministry insists they will wipe Hamas off the face 

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:32.790
of the earth. But Hamas fighters make up just about 

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:36.210
1% of the population. In the densely packed Gaza 

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.420
Strip. It's sealed off from Israel by that security 

00:16:39.420 --> 00:16:42.990
barrier, and now they're encircled by Israeli troops 

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:46.230
and being pounded by airstrikes. Palestinian 

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:49.410
health officials are saying they're running out of food, they're running out of 

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:52.980
water. Israel has turned off the switch to electricity 

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.370
there. There's a humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza 

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.520
right now. The danger is that it deepens the passions among 

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.670
the Palestinians who even among those who never 

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:06.030
liked Hamas, because living under siege is 

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:09.240
really tough. And the most important thing about the future 

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.630
is where are their hearts, where are their passions and where are their commitments 

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:16.470
? And a siege is not going to help make them. Fans of Israel 

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:19.860
. The port of Haifa in Palestine lies shattered by bombs and strewn 

00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:23.670
with dead. Today's conflict has a complicated, bloody history 

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:27.150
, with its roots in competing religious and ancestral claims 

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.450
to this land stretching back millennia. It is 

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.610
what all the participants hope is 

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:36.060
the first step toward breaking the cycle of violence in the Middle East 

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.840
. But in 1993, there was some hope for peace 

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.960
. Oh, there you have it. The handshake 

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.710
. Israel officially recognized the Palestine Liberation 

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.920
Organization, or PLO, in exchange for the group 

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.220
renouncing terrorism and recognizing Israel's 

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.790
right to exist. Hamas responded with violence 

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.970
and predictably, the Muslim fundamentalists of Hamas 

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:03.150
took credit for the killings, calling them gifts to Yasser 

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:06.390
Arafat. The peace settlement and all the traitors 

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.630
Hamas, which receives funding 

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:13.260
from Iran and is labeled a terrorist organization by the U.S 

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.650
and the EU came to control the Gaza Strip when it won 

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:20.190
parliamentary elections in 2006. The idea 

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.460
promoted by the United States was to get the Palestinians on both 

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.030
the West Bank and Gaza to speak with one voice elect 

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:30.540
, Yasser Arafat's Fatah party, the traditional PLO 

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.200
, as the government which was willing to deal with Israel. But 

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.380
there was such alienation and disillusionment with the 

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.800
PLO that populations turned to 

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.890
Hamas, and that has prevented any kind of peace process because 

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.490
the Palestinians are divided between the two territories and 

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:51.030
have very different ideas about how to move forward with Israel 

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.270
. While progress toward peace has stalled 

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:56.550
between Israelis and Palestinians in a 

00:18:56.550 --> 00:19:00.450
two state solution seems increasingly unlikely. Israel 

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.900
has made peace with several Arab countries 

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.710
. Why are we seeing this conflict explode 

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:10.890
again now? Hamas went to war, I think for a 

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.100
variety of reasons. Israel was engaged in 

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.430
possible eventual talks 

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:20.670
with Saudi Arabia brokered by the United States, which 

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.180
would have been the most important peace process between Israel 

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.390
and the Arabs, because Saudi Arabia is the guardian of Islam's holy 

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:30.690
places. In your view, why now? Because they 

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:34.050
could. And because we let our guard down. Frankly 

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.260
. And we're going to have to address that failure 

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:40.830
when the smoke clears. Michael Oren thinks Iran's involvement 

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:44.130
supporting Hamas adds to the risk that this conflict 

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.340
will only widen. But born in the US, he made 

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.700
his home in Israel and says in the longer term 

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.060
he sees progress. I wonder how you see 

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.480
the prospect for peace. Is this just 

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:00.600
an intractable issue? When I moved here 

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.990
, there was no peace with Egypt. There was no peace with Jordan 

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:07.530
, Morocco, UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, peace with 

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:10.920
Saudi Arabia. We had no relations with India. We had no relations 

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.550
with the Soviet bloc. We had no relations with China 

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.210
, with Africa. I mean, totally isolated because if you would have told me 

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.510
nearly a half century ago that this is what Israel's foreign relations would 

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:25.020
look like, I'd say, you know, what type 

00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:28.680
of narcotic are you on, really? Do not underestimate 

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.980
the possibilities and the hope for peace 

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.160
. So for all of the heartache of today, I'm 

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.460
hearing that you have hope. Certainly 

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.520
. Of course I do 

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.760


00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:48.000


00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.240

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.790

begun. Why did you want to share your story? Water off this high 

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.240
. Where are these coming from? That's the million dollar question. I'm a very 

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.390
curious person. I wake up every morning asking what's happening 

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.780
in the world? Why is this happening and how do we answer that question on the CBS 

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.900
Evening News, an original documentary 

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.560
from CBS reports Imagine yourself in Manhattan 

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:46.800
with no police, no army, no mayor. The people of 

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.430
Haiti stare down poverty, corruption, natural disasters 

00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.350
and violence. 

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.830
90% of the guns that are used by gangs 

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:59.340
in Haiti are American guns. But with an unbreakable spirit 

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:02.550
, an eternal optimism. There are days where I 

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:06.060
cry, but we can't be discouraged. We still believe

in Haiti. They're still able to look ahead with hope. Haiti 

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:13.470

aim every night to be factual and fair. That's 

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:30.660
our goal. An original documentary from CBS 

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.900
reports Controversial Congressman Jorge Santos. Why 

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.140
won't you answer our questions? How did he manage to get elected? Thank 

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.320
you very much and God bless you and God bless the USA 

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.620
. Jorge Santos campaign was a campaign of deceit 

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:47.310
, lies, fabrication, and who is he really 

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:50.610
? I knew him as Anthony Duvalier from Queens 

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.730
. Really? Who he is, He's a fraud. I compare him to the Tinder swindler 

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.940
from people who know him. The truth, the facts 

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.980
, the lies. He would say that he was 

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.460
worth $100 million. It's an incredibly cynical episode 

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.670

think asked direct questions don't know that they're tough questions 

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:39.540
per se. Why aren't you holding yourself to that standard? It doesn't look like Congress is doing 

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.750
anything. What has to happen? That's the role of face 

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:46.350
the Nation to focus on the issues at hand. And that means a civil 

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:49.440
conversation with perspective 

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.680


00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.430
. You're about to see American weapons 

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.790

is who's doing something about this? Nobody 

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:12.630
reports exclusive. Most Americans 

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.870
have no idea that we are effectively arming the enemy 

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:19.470
next door. This is the story the American people need to know. Arming cartels 

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.560
is now streaming on the free CBS News app 

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.310
. He's an expert on the art of war 

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:29.820
. And with Ukraine and now Israel in the headlines 

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:33.060
, it's an all too relevant topic. David Martin 

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:36.270
is talking with retired General David Petraeus 

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:39.690
. This is going to be a very, very tough 

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.750
fight. Retired General David Petraeus, who commanded 

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:46.050
America's wars in both Iraq and Afghanistan 

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:49.380
, knows from experience what Israel is facing 

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:52.860
in its war against Hamas. I almost can't imagine 

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:56.550
in a more challenging, contextual 

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.700
set of circumstances here 

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.090
than what they face sending an army 

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.300
, even one as powerful as Israel's, into the densely 

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.390
populated neighborhoods of Gaza. There 

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.780
are tunnels. There will be rooms that will have improvised 

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:16.350
explosive devices. You have to clear every building 

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.590
, every floor, every room, every basement 

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:23.100
, every tunnel. Civilian losses are inevitable 

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.400
and tough Israeli losses lie ahead as well 

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.700
. Petraeus, along with British historian Andrew 

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.760
Roberts, has just written a book titled Conflict 

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.120
A Word, which has come to Define the Century, which 

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.540
began on nine divided by 11. This is far 

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:43.200
worse than nine divided by 11 as horrific 

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:44.1000
as nine divided by 11 was the 

00:25:44.1000 --> 00:25:49.110
October 7th attack on Israel killed a far greater proportion 

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:52.320
of its much smaller population. This is the 

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.650
equivalent of the US having 

00:25:55.650 --> 00:25:59.190
experienced over 40,000 losses rather 

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:02.490
than the 3000 terrible losses that we sustained 

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.770
in the attacks on nine divided by 11. 

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:08.040
On September 11th, it was planes 

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.310
. On October 7th, it was thousands of rockets 

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:14.520
and fighters, even gliders 

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.910
. The complexity of what they did was really 

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:21.450
quite extraordinary. Were you surprised by the 

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.690
sophistication of the attack? Yes, actually, I was more 

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.960
surprised that there just 

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.080
wasn't the awareness of what was being planned 

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:34.530
. Petraeus was once director of the CIA and 

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:38.070
can't understand how both Israeli and American intelligence 

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.670
missed preparations for the attack. This 

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.790
is a very substantial operation and the planning of it 

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:48.420
alone would have been very considerable. But then the training 

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:51.660
and equipping and positioning of forces, then the 

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.320
actual conduct of it, that all of that could take place. And 

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:58.950
not spark much increase military readiness 

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.130
is really quite stunning 

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:05.790
. How do you account for it? Dramatic improvement in 

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:09.060
Hamas's operational security, Very 

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:12.300
, very creative use of these 

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:15.690
munitions and capabilities to degrade 

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:19.200
dramatically, in some cases, knock out the Israeli ability 

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.710
to see what is going on around this quite formidable 

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.920
, all iron fence that was established 

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.430
. At the very least, it would be safe to say that Israel underestimated 

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.940
its enemy. No question about it. What do you think Hamas hoped 

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:36.360
to achieve with this attack? What their leaders have 

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.990
said was to get the world's attention 

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.290
on could. The Hamas objective has been 

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:46.380
have been as simple as kill Jews 

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.950
? Oh, well, that's always the objective. Again, destroy Israel 

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:53.460
. Hamas killed Jews but didn't destroy Israel 

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.120
. And now Israel has vowed to destroy Hamas 

00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:00.510
. Tell me how this ends. If the mission to 

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:03.960
the Israeli military is to destroy Hamas 

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:07.260
, if you have to destroy every headquarters 

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.590
, if you have to capture or kill the bulk of the leaders, if 

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:13.830
you have to do the same with the bulk of these terrorist 

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:16.950
fighters. The question is then, what do you 

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.250
do with Gaza once you retake it 

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.490
? You can't walk away from Gaza If Hamas is 

00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:26.670
destroyed, there will be a power vacuum in Gaza, which 

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:30.390
Israel can't ignore. This is a very tough decision 

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.990
if you're going to have to reoccupy and administer 

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.260
Gaza again, because clearly you can't go in 

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:40.650
, destroy the Hamas infrastructure and then 

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.430
leave because, again, they will reconstitute 

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:48.030
, root themselves. And what happens to the people of Gaza 

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:51.270
? Well, they're going to suffer. And the 

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:54.870
Hamas has brought this on them. We stand 

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.050
. And with Israel, President Biden has promised to back 

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:01.440
Israel to the hilt, sending two aircraft carrier strike 

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.530
groups off the coast, as well as flying in fresh 

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.920
stocks of munitions and 

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.370
with its own invasion of Iraq, the U.S has also 

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.730
left Israel with an object lesson in the perils 

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.760
of overreacting to a terrorist attack 

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:21.150
. We've made mistakes, which is what happens when 

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.660
a nation gets its blood up. Is 

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.990
real, certainly has its blood up. Now there should be 

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:31.140
a cautionary tale from our experiences in the 

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.620
wake of the nine divided by 11 attacks. Some of the actions that we took, we 

00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.980
look at differently now. And there will come a time where some of the 

00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:41.370
actions that will be taken by Israel will be looked at in 

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:44.610
in a different way as well. I actually think that there 

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:48.150
is a consciousness of this in Jerusalem 

00:29:48.150 --> 00:29:51.240
. I'm 

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:54.480


00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.720


00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.960


00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.290
a story's just begun 

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:07.530
. Why did you want to share your story? Water off this high where 

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:11.160
are these coming from? That's the million dollar question. I'm a very curious person 

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.430
. I wake up every morning asking what's happening in the world? Why is this 

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.670
happening and how do we answer that question? On the CBS Evening News

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.880


00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.390
. Hello, everyone. I'm Nancy Chen. Thank you for joining us here on CBS 

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:43.020
News. We are following developments in the Middle East as Israel prepares 

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.470
for a potential ground invasion of Gaza. US Secretary 

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:49.770
of State Antony Blinken is set to visit Tel Aviv tomorrow. He 

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:53.190
spoke to reporters in Cairo earlier today following meetings 

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:56.430
with leaders in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Secretary Blinken 

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:59.790
says the US will continue to assist Israel's right to 

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:03.210
defend itself from Hamas. Israel 

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.600
has the right indeed it has the obligation to defend 

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.870
itself against these attacks from Hamas and 

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:13.260
to try to do what it can to make sure that this never happens again 

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.560
. The way that Israel does this matters 

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.310
. It needs to do it in a way that affirms 

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:23.460
the shared values that we have for human life. And 

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.970
human dignity. Taking every possible precaution 

00:34:26.970 --> 00:34:30.330
to avoid harming civilians and prime 

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:33.870
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with his emergency unity government 

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:37.290
for the first time today. It comes as Israel continues 

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:40.440
to attack Gaza by air as it prepares for a potential 

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.770
ground invasion. CBS News's Charlie D'Agata has more 

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:47.010
from Tel Aviv. Israeli artillery and 

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:50.250
airstrikes have been pounding Gaza for 

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:53.580
the eighth straight day in one of the most intense and 

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:57.390
sustained bombardments that territory has ever seen 

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:58.980
. The UN says as many as 

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:03.030
a million people have been displaced from their homes, some of them heeding 

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:06.510
the call. The warning from Israeli forces 

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:10.260
dropped in leaflets over Gaza to evacuate the north 

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:13.950
to the south ahead of this expected Israeli 

00:35:13.950 --> 00:35:17.340
offensive. We've seen for ourselves Israeli ground troops 

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:20.880
getting ready for that battle. And an indication today 

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.090
from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who convened 

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.100
his emergency expanded 

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.640
cabinet for the first time, saying Hamas thought 

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:33.150
it would destroy us. Instead, we 

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:36.750
will destroy Hamas. Nancy. Charlie 

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:40.290
D'Agata, thank you. And that does it for now. I'm Nancy Chen, CBS 

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:43.320
Sunday morning is next 

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:46.860
. Come on, baby. Now, you can't fool 

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:50.670
Biscuit. Watch. Whoa. It's Sunday morning 

00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:54.240
on CBS. And here again is Jane 

00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.870
Pauley. You can watch today 

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:01.320
where they earned the title World's 

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.770
Greatest rock and roll Band a long time ago 

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.860
. But the Rolling Stones are still at it, still 

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.310
touring, still making new music legends 

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:14.640
. Indeed. Talking with our Anthony Mason 

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.360
. You don't expect 

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.540
birth announcements from a 60 year old band 

00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.750
, The Rolling Stones. But last month 

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:28.410
in London, the Rolling Stones revealed they'd made 

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:31.680
a new record. Don't get Angry with me 

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.190
, Hackney Diamonds is the Stones 

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:37.590
first album of original music 

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:38.070
in 

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:43.590
18 years. Do you like working in this place? Yeah 

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.890
. The old, old friend of ours, Electric 

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:49.980
Lady at Electric Lady Studios in New 

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:53.490
York, Jimmy, where the band worked on the new record. We 

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:56.820
caught up with Keith Richards. Is it like getting on a bike when you 

00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:00.090
guys go in the studio? Pretty much. But you're 

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:03.240
not sure if the tires are pumped up 

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.480
? What is he doing here? I'm with you 

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:10.110
over in London, Mick 

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:13.410
Jagger and Ronnie Wood joined us. So how 

00:37:13.410 --> 00:37:16.770
did this come about? Well. Well 

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:20.310
, well. My recollection 

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:23.700
is that Mick said what we need to do is say, let's 

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.360
make an album, let's blitz it. Basically, that was the impetus 

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.720
. We just have to have a record ready to go out on tour. So there was 

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.990
a deadline and then we more or less did what we said. We planned 

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:37.170
to do. It's really unusual. Yeah, really unusual. And 

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:40.380
I think I said to Keith, It's going to be finished by Valentine's Day and Keith 

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.620
looked at me like, How quickly do you know in a recording studio 

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.830
when you have something, you got to give it 

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.870
a minute. You can't be dismissive if you 

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.300
don't get it in the first one minute, but you kind of get to 

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.810
know in ten minutes. I'd say, yeah, that quickly take long 

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:58.350
to know if something's really there and whether it's worth chasing 

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:01.770
. And it's a bit like a painting you construct. You do 

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.890
the first layout and then you give it a breath. You 

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:08.040
know, go away are a painter. Well, we don't have 

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:11.640
but let him have his analogy come back and fill the jigsaw 

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.880
. You know, I love that people aren't Van Gogh, man 

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:18.120
. Van Gogh away. Please 

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:21.540
don't get angry with me. The album's lead 

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.720
single Angry, started with a lyric from 

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.900
Jagger. I was just playing guitar 

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:31.560
in the Caribbean on my own and just came up with the idea 

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:34.950
and then took it to the next level with Keith and 

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:38.280
Mick, and we kind of kick each other up the ass, you know 

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:42.030
, and like that, don't like that. And whatever 

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:45.630
it is, it's a sort of chemistry. But the band's 

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:49.050
chemistry was rocked. Never nervous, never 

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:52.830
stop and start me up. When drummer and founding 

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:55.080
member Charlie Watts died 

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:58.440
in 2021 and start me up 

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.770
, did you feel the need to put an album out? I 

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:05.400
think maybe because of Charlie's demise 

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.910
that we felt that if 

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:12.180
the Stones were going to continue, then we'd better 

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.570
make a mark of what the Stones are now. Was it hard for you 

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:18.720
on tour to look back and not see Charlie there? Yeah, it's 

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.900
it's of course it's hard. I mean, it's all my life, ever since I 

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:25.230
was 19 or whatever, it's always been Charlie on some level 

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:28.350
, it had to be emotional not to have Charlie. Of course it's emotional, but you 

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:31.620
have to get past that in life, you know, Love, Charlie, all the things. But I 

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.860
still want to carry on making music everywhere 

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:38.520
I hear the sound of marching. Charlie 

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:41.730
in Playboy last year, the 

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:45.060
Stones toured with new drummer Steve Jordan 

00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.040
, but Watts 

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.310
plays on two tracks on the album, including 

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.030
one with the Stones original bassist Bill Wyman 

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.290
, who left the band 

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:59.430
in 1993. Did Bill have 

00:39:59.430 --> 00:40:02.700
to be coaxed to come back? Bill Wyman No, not at all. I phoned him 

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.970
and said, Are you still playing the bass? Even was a bit worried 

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:09.150
. He said, What do you mean playing? Every day I'm making an album. I said, Great, Bill 

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:12.420
, you come and do this track because Charlie is on it and like 

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.660
it to be reunited. The original rhythm section would be a cool 

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.720
idea. Time 

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:22.140
is on my side. Yes, it is 

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.390
. When those original Rolling Stones 

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:26.220
first formed in London 

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:30.750
in 1962, they never imagined it would last 

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.930
. That I can't get no. Remember when 

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:37.260
we had the first hit record? We kind of looked at each 

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.380
other with like dismay, saying, Well, we got about 

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:43.590
two years, boys, and then you've got to find a 

00:40:43.590 --> 00:40:46.800
job. Yeah. No 

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.646
, it's only rock and roll, but I like it. 

00:40:49.646 --> 00:40:53.160
And nine and yes, I do like 

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.160
it, but it's out all right. 

00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.580
Six decades later, dark glasses 

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.910
, the gas, gas, gas. They're still one of the biggest touring 

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:04.860
acts in the world, 

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:10.740
grossing $179 million last year alone. Well 

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.800
, camper boy to 

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.160
said the same for all band. We just 

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:20.340
are pioneers in a way that no one's done 

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.550
. 60 years of rock and roll ever Ronnie 

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:27.120
Wood at 76 the youngest stone 

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.870
Do you paint every day? Well, when I can, yeah. When I'm not playing the guitar 

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:34.260
has a side gig as a painter. I'm inspired 

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.590
here, for instance, by Delacroix. That's what keeps me going. And then 

00:41:37.590 --> 00:41:40.110
I go, Wow, you know, we're going to play music next. 

00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:42.390
And it just one runs into the other. His 

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:45.690
two artistic passions merge on tour 

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.900
. There's Coachella when he makes these set lists after 

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.170
every show. It's a kind of memoir. Oh, that 

00:41:52.170 --> 00:41:55.350
was when that happened. That's what we played. Do you know how many shows you've 

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:58.440
done? No. No. What 

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.740
? Have you ever considered writing a memoir? Oh, yeah, I've considered it. And 

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:05.160
I've been offered a lot of money. And. And I've seen people 

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.230
do it, and it takes, like, two years. 

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:10.380
They're living two years in their past. And that doesn't appeal to you that 

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:13.740
does not appeal to me. So someone else will just have to remember 

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.130
it for me. Both Jagger and Richards have 

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:20.850
landmark birthdays this year. Yeah. Yes 

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:24.510
. Yes. The big eight zero. Richards 

00:42:24.510 --> 00:42:27.810
in December. How does that feel? I asked Mick 

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:30.840
because he's six months older than me. Yes 

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.110
. And he says it's not that different. Jagger became 

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:37.380
an octogenarian back in July. Well, it's a 

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.650
bit overblown, you know, it's not all it's cracked up to be. Being 80, I don't 

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.980
think. There's no really options here. Yeah, you're either going to get there 

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.040
or you're not. Well, you've gotten there in pretty good shape. Well, thank you. That's very kind 

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:50.430
. Pleased to meet you. Hope 

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.730
you get my nurse. He's singing the best he's ever sang 

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:56.820
. Think now that's another reason we're going to keep going when 

00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.030
you got it, flaunt it. You know, nature of 

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:03.390
my game. Why do you think you 

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:06.750
guys have endured? I think we basically 

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:10.170
we love each other and we love our music. And when you're doing 

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.590
it, you don't really think about it. But I think with Charlie going 

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:17.010
, I've realized more and more how special 

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:20.160
that that is 

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:23.610
. I've been there's something about the Stones and there's something 

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:26.850
about us all that sort of said, No, we stick 

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:30.030
together. Yeah. And then you can't 

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:33.360
just drop it, you know, you got to. You got to follow 

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.480
it right down to the end, down the tunnel, you know, as 

00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.600
you said, it's bigger than all of you. Yeah, it is 

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.840
. Damn thing 

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.080


00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.320


00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:52.560


00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.800


00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.040


00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.670
. An original documentary from CBS reports 

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:05.970
. I always tell people that Twitter would not be Twitter without 

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:09.210
black Twitter. It's just us being in fellowship with each 

00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:12.540
other and it becomes a conversation. You don't want to be left out of people 

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.870
really started to recognize the power of activism on 

00:44:15.870 --> 00:44:19.620
Twitter based on that one tweet the hashtag OscarsSoWhite 

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:23.310
was trending around the world. If anything has really powered 

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:26.910
black Twitter, it's been humor. If your food ain't right 

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:30.330
. Oh, we going to tell you about that, too. So we tend to create 

00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:33.600
change, create culture and cool. That's how 

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.020
movements happen on Black Twitter and go beyond more than 

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.590
that. Black Twitter, the Twitter verse that changed a generation 

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:43.680
now streaming on the free CBS News app 

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.430
. It's a history making meeting for extraordinary 

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:50.610
women who are all four star generals and admirals. How 

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:53.910
did you deal with being discriminated against? I just worked harder 

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:57.270
. The future of an ever evolving US military. When 

00:44:57.270 --> 00:45:00.750
we go person to person, our 

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:04.020
commentary this morning takes us back to the Middle East 

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:07.140
. It's from Yuval Noah Harari, author 

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.320
of the bestselling book Sapiens 

00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.180
. Israel has just 

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:16.320
experienced its 911 moment in Terror 

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:19.770
. Communities have been slaughtered. My 

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:22.920
aunt and uncle are members of one of these communities 

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:26.310
, Kibbutz Be'eri. They hid in their house 

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:29.790
as terrorists were butchering their neighbors 

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:33.510
. I received word that they somehow survived 

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:36.930
, and many of my friends have just received the worst 

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:40.560
news of their lives. We know three things about this horrendous 

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.310
attack. First, Hamas aimed to kill civilians 

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:47.850
, us. Second, the victims were tortured 

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:51.060
and executed in the most gruesome ways 

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.690
the terrorists could imagine. Third, instead 

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:58.170
of hiding the atrocities, Hamas made sure 

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:01.500
they will be publicized. Why do 

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.800
such a thing? Because Hamas is waging a war 

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.010
on our souls like ISIS. Hamas 

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:11.490
uses unspeakable atrocities to terrify millions and 

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:14.760
to sow seeds of hatred and violence 

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:18.510
. Hamas is thereby committing a crime against humanity 

00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:21.870
. It is not just killing humans. Hamas is trying 

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.530
to destroy our trust in humanity and thereby 

00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:29.220
destroy our own humanity. A vicious 

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.520
cycle of violence now threatens to consume the 

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.760
entire region, ruining the lives 

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:39.390
of millions of Palestinians as well as Israelis 

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:42.810
. But the people of Israel are stronger than Hamas 

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:46.380
thinks, with the help of true friends like 

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:49.980
President Joe Biden, we will overcome 

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.790
the terror and hatred Hamas spreads, rebuild 

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:57.120
our country and our trust in humanity 

00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:00.480
, and stay loyal to Israel's founding 

00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:04.230
ideals, democracy at home and peace 

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:07.320
abroad 

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:10.560


00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.800


00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.040


00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:20.400
. An original 

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.700
documentary from CBS reports. I always tell people 

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:26.880
that Twitter would not be Twitter without black Twitter 

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.180

to recognize the power of activism on Twitter based 

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:39.990

women who are all four star generals and admirals. How did 

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:13.980
you deal with being discriminated against? I just worked harder 

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:17.340
. The future of an ever evolving US military. When 

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:20.790
we go person to person. John 

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:24.330
Dickerson is in conversation with columnist and author David 

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:27.690
Brooks, who's wondering what life might be like 

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:30.930
if we all felt just a little more seen and 

00:48:30.930 --> 00:48:34.260
heard. Presentation of the story of David Brooks 

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:37.830
is on a one man mission aimed at no less than changing 

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:41.160
human behavior. So here we are on a street corner being watched 

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:44.340
. This is a good chance for both of us to be emotionally vulnerable and 

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:47.730
seen by everyone. Right? So what's 

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:51.330
your hope for this book? David Yeah, I'm hoping that people 

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:53.490
just learn to see each other, that there's 

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:57.060
one skill at the center of any healthy family community 

00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:00.570
organization or country. It's the ability to see each other 

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:03.600
and to make each other feel seen and heard and understood 

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:07.350
. For the last several years, Brooks has been on to writing tracks 

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:10.950
for his New York Times column, addresses politics and society 

00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:14.070
. His books have been an examination of character 

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:17.370
, morality and personal architecture. His 

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:19.530
latest book, How to Know a Person. 

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:23.190
And he's the first to admit it's partly about how to know himself 

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:26.670
. Would you cop to your book being a self-help 

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:29.910
book? I'm not shy about that. It's I'm trying 

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:33.540
to help myself, so. Right, Right. So it's selfish. I'm trying to help myself 

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:36.870
, but hope it'll be helpful to others. And in my view, every book should 

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:40.350
be a self-help book. You should be able to learn something that'll improve 

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:43.770
who you are. Brooks is not just concerned with himself 

00:49:43.770 --> 00:49:46.920
, though. He writes, We're living in the middle of some sort of 

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.430
vast emotional, relational and spiritual crisis 

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:54.150
. It is as if people across society have lost the ability 

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:57.330
to see and understand one another, thus producing 

00:49:57.330 --> 00:50:00.900
a culture that can be brutalizing and isolating 

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.080
. If we don't see 

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.440
others. What are the stakes? Well, I think there's nothing crueler than to 

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:10.770
be indifferent to someone to make someone feel invisible 

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:13.980
. And that's happening. The problem, the skill that I'm talking 

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:17.190
about, we don't teach it in school and often we don't teach 

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:20.550
it anywhere. The book's thesis is that while human relations 

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:24.300
are hard, the skills can be taught. And if people can improve 

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.990
their one on one interactions in listening, in conversation 

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:31.170
, and in what Brooks calls the close at hand 

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:34.560
, it might have a compounding effect on society 

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.890
. You write about Diminishers and Illuminators. What's 

00:50:37.890 --> 00:50:41.220
the distinction there? Yeah, so my theory is that in any group of people there 

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:44.640
are some people who are diminishers. They make you feel invisible, unseen 

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:47.670
. They're not curious about you, they stereotype you. They label 

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:51.150
you. And then there are other people who are illuminators and 

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:54.600
they are people who are just curious about you and they make you feel lit 

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:58.200
up to lift up those Illuminators Brooks started, We've 

00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:01.830
the Social Fabric Project for six years. The nonprofit 

00:51:01.830 --> 00:51:05.310
it has been supporting people who, as he says, are working 

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:08.940
to weave together the social fabric in their communities 

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:12.360
. We intend to restore souls here. People 

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:15.720
like Renee Mitchell in Portland, Oregon, who started the soul 

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:19.230
Restoration Center. I'm always, you know, working 

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:22.710
with youth who don't see themselves reflected, you know. So I 

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:25.800
have to give them something that says that I see you 

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:29.490
, I honor you and your experiences. She basically 

00:51:29.490 --> 00:51:32.910
embodies everything I learned over four years of writing this book. She 

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:36.270
builds strength in people who have been wounded by 

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:39.480
injustices of society and 

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:43.170
she's everything. I'm not the challenge. As Brooks acknowledges 

00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:46.830
, is that the forces of modern life, social media, partisanship 

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:50.040
pull at our attention, rile us up, turn 

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:53.250
the other into the enemy. Even he was not 

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:56.430
immune to these forces. Recently, the now 

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:59.700
famous $78 tweet, it's been seen 

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:02.910
some millions of times. Yeah. Last month, while 

00:52:02.910 --> 00:52:05.010
eating at Newark Airport, Brooks posted 

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:08.670
about his $78 launch of a burger and bourbon. This 

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:11.880
is why Americans feel the economy is terrible, he wrote 

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:15.360
. The response was not favorable. He was accused of being 

00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.600
misleading because the booze and not the food was pricey 

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:21.930
, accused of being out of touch, entitled and worse 

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:24.030
. The Post has been viewed more than 

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:27.930
38 million times. Why does that reaction surprise you 

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:31.050
? It's like every screw up I've 

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:34.440
made on social media. Not too many, but like thought about that tweet 

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.800
for like three seconds and I sent it out 

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.130
and it started out as being a joke. It was like a picture of 

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:44.550
a meal I was eating at an airport with a burger, fries and bourbon and 

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:48.060
it was probably the least healthy meal I hope ate that week. And so it started 

00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:51.630
out as look and it was 78 bucks. The joke in my head was 

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:54.720
, I can't even afford to make poor lifestyle choices 

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.050
, but the way I wrote it was incredibly stupid. And so 

00:52:58.050 --> 00:53:01.470
it seemed like I was oblivious to something that's blindingly obvious 

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:05.070
, which is that me, as a New York Times columnist 

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:08.520
and a well-off, lucky, privileged journalist, as 

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:12.000
if I'm not aware that that's very different than a family living 

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.270
paycheck to paycheck. Brooks started as a times 

00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:18.570
columnist 20 years ago as the conservative on the op ed 

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.930
page, he often infuriated liberals, but recently 

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:25.200
, he says he's become more liberal out of sync 

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.290
with much of the Trump era. The Republican Party used to be 

00:53:28.290 --> 00:53:31.740
the party. You weren't thrilled by them, but they were the business party 

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:35.160
. They knew how to run things. And that seems like eons or 

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:38.400
light years ago. You wrote recently after the Republican debate 

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:41.700
that it demonstrated the disease of narcissistic 

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:44.850
hucksterism. I think that's what Donald Trump has brought into our 

00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:48.480
life. What's narcissistic hucksterism? It's what Vivek Ramaswamy 

00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:51.690
was doing in that debate. It's like you don't have to tell the 

00:53:51.690 --> 00:53:55.050
truth. You just have to tell the entertaining thing 

00:53:55.050 --> 00:53:58.140
that makes you a showman. How many human beings can take a mug 

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.530
shot and turn it into a positive thing for them? And Brooks thinks there's 

00:54:01.530 --> 00:54:04.620
not a small chance that Donald Trump could end up back in 

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.960
the White House. And so I think 

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:10.320
there's a 40% chance that Donald Trump wins re-election 

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.920
. I wouldn't say the majority, but I take it extremely seriously 

00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:17.190
. So does David Brooks have the prescription to save us from 

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:20.490
ourselves, or is he a lonely voice crying 

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:23.910
in the wilderness? One of the unifying ideas 

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:27.450
in politics, whether you're on the left or the right, is that these 

00:54:27.450 --> 00:54:30.540
are dire times and the wolf is at the door and 

00:54:30.540 --> 00:54:33.780
so in those times, do you worry that what 

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:37.020
you're prescribing in this book, which is to see the other is 

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:40.290
naive because people are saying, well, fine, but 

00:54:40.290 --> 00:54:43.530
the wolf's at the door and I'm not going to say, boy, isn't that some 

00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:47.100
nice fur you have? Yeah, well, I don't think the wolf's at the door 

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.550
. I found it's very hard, but everybody does mean left and right 

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:54.000
, you know? But not me. Yeah, I find it's very 

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.630
hard to hate people up close. All you have to do is show a little hint of humanity 

00:54:57.630 --> 00:55:00.990
and say, Oh, and then suddenly all 

00:55:00.990 --> 00:55:04.650
the wolf at the door stuff diminishes. It's not naive 

00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:08.430
to lead with trust. It's not naive to lead with respect 

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:11.640
, but it's practical. And so 

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:14.790
guess reject the idea that I'm being like a babe in the woods in 

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:18.090
a world of wolves. I've got the the tools that are 

00:55:18.090 --> 00:55:21.240
the most aggressively effective 

00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:24.480
at countering the wolf 

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:27.720

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:41.370
from CBS reports. I always tell people that Twitter 

00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:44.820
would not be Twitter without black Twitter. It's just us being 

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.090
in fellowship with each other and it becomes a conversation. You don't 

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:51.180
want to be left out of. People really started to recognize the 

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:53.670
power of activism on Twitter based on 

00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:57.360
that one tweet, the hashtag OscarsSoWhite was trending 

00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:00.780
around the world. If anything has really powered black 

00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:04.080
Twitter, it's been humor. If your food ain't right 

00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:07.800
. Oh, we going to tell you about that, too. So we tend to create change 

00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:11.100
, change, create culture and cool. That's how movements 

00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:14.370

person. I wake up every morning asking what's happening in the world? Why

spirit and eternal optimism. There are days where 

00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:55.020
I cry, but we can't be discouraged. We 

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:58.410

00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:01.920

00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.070

to get elected? Thank you very much and God bless you and God bless 

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:32.610

00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:35.970
of deceit, lies, fabrication, and who is 

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:39.720
he really? I knew him as Anthony Duvalier from 

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:43.020
Queens. Really? Who he is. He's a fraud. I compare him to the Tinder 

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:46.590
swindler from people who know him. The truth, the facts 

00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:48.720
, the lies. He would say that he was 

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:52.320
worth $100 million. It's an incredibly cynical episode in

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.110
documentary from CBS reports. He started out as a 

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:55.290
fun loving party boy, but the alcohol got the better of 

01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:58.530
him. What I envisioned was him being in some sort of medical 

01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:01.980
facility. I just thought what a great candidate 

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:05.340
for them to learn about the results of alcoholism 

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:08.550
