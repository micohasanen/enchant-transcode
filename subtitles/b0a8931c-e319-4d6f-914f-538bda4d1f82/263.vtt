when you have something, you got to give it 

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:48.870 
a minute. You can't be dismissive if you 

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.300 
don't get it in the first one minute, but you kind of get to 

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.810 
know in ten minutes. I'd say, yeah, that quickly take long
